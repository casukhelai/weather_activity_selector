# Team-04-Collaborative_Project_1

## Overview: 
The purpose of <insert site name> is to provide the user with an activity to do based on the weather. If the user is bored or looking for something to do, they should be able to enter their location into the site. Upon submitting the location, the site will check the weather to determine the weather then provide an activity to do based on the weather details. This site will utilize both https://openweathermap.org/api and www.boredapi.com APIs to achieve this response. 

## User Stories

## Future Development
1. Add something like a “loading screen” like in video games
   - Case I:  API loads slower than the timer counting down, then we could display quotes, random facts, etc. for a second
     - Would need to check each second to see if the API had finished counting down, if it had then we would display 
   - Case II: the user has fast internet, so the timer is unnecessary
     - Can immediately display the results
2. If the user doesn’t like their randomly generated activity, add a “return to landing page” button, so they don’t have to refresh 
3. Identify random activity  based on participants (5 max limit allowed by BoredAPI ) , accessibility and user friendly choice of price to get optimized outcomes .
4. Enhance user experience by including audio and visual effects.
5. Allow user to specify which state they’re in (Columbus, OH vs Columbus, GA)
